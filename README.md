## How Restrat works
**ReStrat** is a collaborative system for the registration of requests for aid (essential items) and the fulfillment of needs in a community affected by a natural disaster (e.g., flood, earthquake, etc.). Through the platform, a **citizen** can declare that they have specific needs for various items (e.g., water, food, medicine) or indicate that they have a surplus and can donate specific items. Also, **volunteers** have the ability to view all citizen requests or offers on a map, and each vehicle can take on one or more pick-up/delivery missions. Similarly, citizens can access the platform from their mobile phones and declare their needs for various items. The system's database can, at chosen times, announce different items that are in shortage, and these announcements appear on citizens' mobile devices. Each citizen can then declare if they have the items requested by the system, so they can be collected by volunteers.

This project is part of **Programming & Systems in World Wide Web** compulsory course in Computer Engineering & Informatics Department of University of Patras for Winter Semester 2023-2024 (Semester 7).
